      "I build applied machine learning systems for biological and genomic data, translating ideas from research into production-ready models and pipelines. My work focuses on genomic language models, transformer-based NLP, scalable data pipelines, and interpretable ML that turn complex data into systems people can actually use.",
      "My background spans industry and applied research. I’ve worked on metagenomics and NLP pipelines, designed production ETL systems, and built analytics and BI solutions that support real, time-sensitive decision-making.",
      "I’m motivated by problems where rigorous modeling meets real-world constraints, especially in healthcare and life sciences, and I enjoy working in collaborative, impact-driven teams that move ideas from concept to deployment."
